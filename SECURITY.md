## Responsible Disclosure Security Policy

A responsible disclosure policy helps protect our users from publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities without a fix by employing a process where vulnerabilities are first triaged in a private manner, and only publicly disclosed after a reasonable time period that allows patching the vulnerability and providing an upgrade path for users.

When contacting us directly, we will do our best efforts to respond in a reasonable time to resolve the issue.

We kindly ask that you refrain from malicious acts that put our users, any contributors, or the project itself at risk.
